# pl-rt

The PortaLinux Runtime, pl-rt for short, is the core runtime of the PortaLinux
operating system. It defines the PortaLinux Runtime API, and it's the main
implementation of the PortaLinux Runtime API as defined in the ESB 2.0
Specification.

It is a heavily modified fork of pl32lib-ng release 1.06

# Build instructions

Currently, it imports the old pl32lib-ng build system, but I might rewrite it.

# Contributions

Since this is a fork of pl32lib-ng, it inherits its no contribution rule. I,
Sophie, will be the only contributor to the project throughout its life.
